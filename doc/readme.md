# hevm Book

The hevm book is built using `mdbook` and `yarn`. Known good versions of both
are included in the nix-shell.

## Running the mdBook server

You can then serve the documentation locally by calling the [`serve`
command][mdbook-serve] from the `book` directory:

```sh
mdbook serve
```

Alternatively it can be called from the root of the repository:

```sh
mdbook serve doc
```

## Updating syntax highlighting

In order to highlight the Solidity code examples in the book we override
mdBook's built-in [highlight.js] with our own. To update the highlighting code,
run the following commands using [yarn]:

```sh
yarn install
yarn build
```

This will build `theme/theme.js` and copy a minified version of the output into
`theme/highlight.js` where it will be picked up by mdbook during build. You
should not need to do this unless you want to modify syntax highlighting in some
way.
